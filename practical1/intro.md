# Welcome to the World Food & Ecosystems practicals
<br />

In these practicals we will explore the intricate relationships between environmental factors, ecosystem dynamics, and agricultural practices. Utilizing advanced tools like Google Earth Engine and Rstudio, you'll analyze real-world data to uncover insights about global ecosystems and food production systems.

This first practical we will get acquinted with the functionalities of Google Earth Engine in three steps:

- **Step 1: Introduction to JavaScript**: We will start by learning the basics of JavaScript, covering some coding examples to build a solid foundation for data analysis and visualization tasks.

- **Step 2: Google Earth Engine (GEE) Overview**: Next, we will explore Google Earth Engine, a powerful platform for geospatial data analysis. You will use scripts to manipulate and visualize environmental data within GEE.

- **Step 3: Gradient Analysis**: Finally, we'll apply our skills to investigate changes in ecosystems and agriculture over geographical gradients. This involves acquiring datasets, perform a gradient analysis, and visualize the results to understand the relationship between plants and their environment.

<br />

Before we begin, it's important to know that there are two types of questions you'll encounter during the practicals.

1. üîç **Recap questions**: These are practice questions, marked by the magnifying glass icon, and are not graded. The answers are provided below each question. However, please make sure to think carefully about these questions before checking the answer‚Äîthis will help you learn more effectively.

2. üìù **Graded questions**: These questions are graded and align with the quizzes on Canvas. When you encounter one of these questions, please provide your answer in Canvas.

## Step 1.1: exploring the interface

If all is well, you have created an account on earth engine by following the instructions on the starting page.
Now that you have your account, you can surf to the [code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
Your screen should look like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89069805/129699267-c9c03178-f0b5-41be-83d9-96596d36e61c.png)

>The code editor basically consists of 4 windows: 
>> - On the bottom of the screen, you can see a basemap, and any spatial information you plot (see later for examples) will show here. 
>> - On the left you see a window depicting the scripts you have written (or got from other people)
>> - The middle of the screen is devoted to the script you are currently working on or running. At the beginning of your adventures, this is still blank. 
>> - On the right the panel shows either 'inspector', 'console' or 'tasks'. For now, the console is most important: here textual information or figures you wish to print or show are given.

## Step 1.2: exploring the code
The Google Earth Engine interface, as you see it above, runs on JavaScript. It might seem scary to be confronted with a new (and at times cryptic) language, but no worries: we'll go step by step. 

To access, explore and use Google Earth Engine, only a basic understanding of JavaScript suffices. As we saw in class, the basic building blocks of writing code (in python, R, Javascript...) is (i) the identification of the necessary variables, (ii) the identification of the appropriate functions, (iii) understanding which input parameters these functions require. 

Of course, although the building blocks are similar, the syntax can differ quite a bit. Some key tips and tricks for JavaScript are listed here (source: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxRKMie8dfTvBmUNOO0TFMkd7ELGWf3WjX0JvESZdOE/edit" target="_blank">Earth Engine 101 Beginner's Curriculum</a>.)

**NOTE**: Try to copy-paste some of these commands to your code editor in google earth and run it: what happens?

<br />

### Commenting lines

Just like using hashes in R, you can make comments in code using slashes in Javascript, see:

```javascript

// Line comments start with two forward slashes. Like this line.

/* Multi-line comments start with a forward slash and a star,
and end with a star and a forward slash. */
```

<br />

### Defining variables

Variables are used to store objects and are defined using the keyword **var**. You can store the number 42 in a variable named theAnswer for instance:

```javascript

var theAnswer = 42;
print(theAnswer);
```

>Note that the equivalent in R would be: 

```r
theAnswer <- 42
print(theAnswer)

```

<br />

### Defining string objects

String objects (texts) start and end with a single quote:

```javascript
var myVariable = 'I am a string';

// string objects can also use double quotes, but don't mix and match
var myOtherVariable = "I am also a string";
```

All statements should end in a semi-colon, or the editor complains.

```javascript

var test = 'I feel incomplete...' //this is wrong
var test2 = 'I feel complete!';   //this is very okay
```

<br />

### Passing function parameters : 

Function parameters are included between parenthesis. 

```javascript
// Parentheses are used to pass parameters to functions
print('This string will print in the Console tab.');
```

<br />

### Building a vector or list with multple items: 

a list is built using [] brackets. 

```javascript
The zero index refers to the first item in a list*/
var myList = ['eggplant','apple','wheat'];
print(myList[0]); // would print 'eggplant' because JavaScript starts counting from 0
```


>Note that in R this is very similar, but slightly different as c() is used to construct lists, and R starts counting from 1 (and not from zero): 

```r
#making a list in R using c() instead of the [] used in javascript
myList <- c('eggplant','apple','wheat')
print(myList[1]);
```

<br />

### Using dictionaries
```javascript

// Curly brackets (or braces) can be used to define dictionaries (key:value pairs).
var myDict = {'food':'bread', 'color':'red', 'number':42};

// Square brackets can be used to access dictionary items by key.
print(myDict['color']);

// Or you can use the dot notation to get the same result.
print(myDict.color);
```

<br />

### Functions

Functions can be defined as a way to reuse code and make it easier to read.


```javascript
var myHelloFunction = function(string) {
  return 'Hello ' + string + '!';
};
print(myHelloFunction('world'));

```

> Again, this looks very similar to what it would be in R

```r
myHelloFunction <- function(string) {
print(paste('Hello', string, '!'))}
myHelloFunction('world')
```
<br />
<br />

## Quiz

Let's review some of the JavaScript functionalities that you just learned. Can you correctly answer the following three questions?

_Inspect the following function_
```javascript
var myHelloFunction = function(string) {
  return 'Hello ' + string + '!';
};
print(myHelloFunction('world'));
```

> üîç **Recap 1**. What is the input required by the function above? <br />
> <br />
> a) A variable named `string` that contains numbers. <br />
> b) Any combination of letters. <br />
> c) The function `myHelloFunction`. <br /> 
> d) All of the above options (_a_, _b_, and _c_) are correct. <br /> 


<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Recap 1. (click on this to show/hide the answer)</summary>
Answer B. The function only takes a string - which is a sequence of letters - as an input. These letters might be stored in a variable, but the input needs to be a text in order for the code to work.
</details>
<br />

Check the following code
```javascript
myVariable = abcdefg
```

> üîç **Recap 2**. In this command, what are potential issues? <br />
> <br />
> a) `;` is missing at the end of line. <br />
> b) variables need to be announced by `var` in the beginning. <br />
> c) strings need 'quotation marks' to define them. <br />
> d) All of the above options (_a_, _b_, and _c_) are correct. <br />

<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Recap 2.</summary>
Answer D. All of the answers are correct.
</details>
<br />

Examine the code below:
```javascript
var myList = ['world','food','and', 'ecosystems'];
```

> üîç **Recap 3**. Which result will you get with `print(myList[4]);` <br />
> <br />
> a) The word `and`. <br />
> b) The word `ecosystems`. <br />
> c) The word `world`. <br />
> d) You will get no result. <br />

<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Recap 3.</summary>
Answer D. In Javascript, lists start with the index 0, thus the 4th index number will be the fifth entry, which does not exist.
</details>

In this practical you will mainly adjust existing pieces of code, to get into the modus operandus. If you want to learn more, [this source from the science park study group](https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/Intro-Google-Earth-Engine-lesson/) is an excellent starting point. 


But now that you know the basics, let's explore its functionalities and continue to exercise 2.
