# Welcome to the 6th practical. 

Today we are going to investigate crop diversity around the world!
This practical is inspired by the publication of Leff et al. which dates back 20 years (to 2004), which focuses on the diversity in crops around the world. We will base ourselves on their methods, but we will work with very recent global crop datasets at very high spatial resolution and we will consider many more crops than considered by Leff et al. In this practical we will evaluate which areas in the world are characterized by very low/high diversity in crop production and try to assess what this means for food security. 

This practical session is entirely in R and is intended to also demonstrate the ease with which R can handle spatial data. Start by creating a new script in R-Studio: Click on *New-file* at the top-left of R-studio and choose *R Script*, give it an appropriate name like: *prac6_agriculture*.

## Step 1: Describing data

<br />

### Problem setting

As introduced in class, we will use camera trap data: these are cameras where each time an animal passes, a picture is taken and AI is used to identify the animal. After some data cleaning and quality checks, the total amount of unique species (species richness) can be calculated for each camera (so each location). The question in this practical will be: for a dataset collected in Costa Rica: which gradients in species richness exist? Based on what we saw in class, we assume here that if there are gradients, they might depend on NDVI. Additionally, because the dataset is acquired on the flanks of a volcano, we will also check the effect of elevation. 

<br />

Now think about the geospatial parameters, how would you go about analysing biodiversity over gradients in Costa Rica? Can you complete the following table and give the answers on the question marks?

| Parameter  |  Value |
|---|---|
| Spatial extent | ? |
| Temporal extent | ? |
| Cartographic unit |  Point data (camera trap observations)  |
| Dimensions | We'll consider the elevation and NDVI
| Dimension description | Elevation: ? , temperature: NDVI: calculated from the LANDSAT 8 mission  |
| Temporal resolution | Static, the observation data is simplified to 2019(!) |
| Spatial resolution | ? |
| Assumption / Hypothesis | Species richness depends on the amount of energy available. Here we will use NDVI as a proxy for net primary production. Additionally, we assume that richness decreases with temperature, and thus will decrease when elevations are higher |

<br />

(!) In reality the data was collected intermittently since 2007 but for the purposes of this practical, the data are aggregated and strongly simplified. Dealing with the temporal dimension of this dataset and with the particularities of data cleaning for camera trapping lies beyond the scope of this course. We *assume*, for the purposes of this exercise, the data is suitable for analysis against a landsat image of the year 2019 (see later). 


And we'll use following data structures and sources:

| Dataset      | Type | Source     |Access point     |
| :---        |    :---    |          :---  |         :---  |
| TEAM-camera data Costa Rica     | vector       | downloadable from canvas, original source: https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/team-network  |
| NDVI    | ?        | LANDSAT 8    |Google Earth Engine: see below     |
| ?  | ?        | ?      | ?    |

### Accessing the data



One of the first things we need to do is install the package needed to handle spatial data :

```R
install.packages("terra")  # for handling spatial data
library(terra)
```




> üìù **Question 1**. The data we use of the camera traps is basically:
> <br />
> ‚Ä¢ Abundance data<br />
> ‚Ä¢ Species richness data, without consideration of abundance <br />
> ‚Ä¢ A weighted combination of abundance and species richness <br />

***

<br />

**NDVI-Map:** <br />
The camera traps are relatively close together, the NDVI datasets that are readily available in the Google Earth Catalogue have a rough spatial resolution (e.g. the based on [MODIS satellites has a 500m resolution](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD13A1). 

> üîç **Review 1**. Why would a readily available NDVI with a resolution of 500m be too rough? <br />

<br />
<details>
<summary>Answer Review 1. (click on this to show/hide the answer)</summary>
Because many camera traps would then fall within the same rastercell of the NDVI-map. This means there is a mismatch in scale, analyzing this data would give you the same NDVI value for different camera traps.
</details>
<br />

We will thus have to make it ourselves based on satellites with a better spatial resolution. One of the options is the LANDSAT 8 mission which collects spectral information in the red and near-infrared spectrum (the bands we need to calculate NDVI) at 30m resolution. All the information on this product is given [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C02_T1_L2).
