# Data Analysis

<br />

Now we are going to do the data analysis in R. First we have to set the working directory to the correct folder and import the data. Force yourself to import the data through code (with the read.csv function) instead of manually importing the data. The following code combines the different datasets into one dataframe (*df*) which we will use from there on.

```R
# Set the working directory to YOUR folder
setwd("C:/Users?/?")

# Load in the biodiversity, geodiversity and climate data
geo <- read.csv("points_geo.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
rich <- read.csv("points_rich.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
rare <- read.csv("points_rare.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
temp <- read.csv("points_temp.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
prec <- read.csv("points_prec.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Create dataframe from data
df <- data.frame(geo$mean, rich$mean, rare$mean, temp$mean, prec$mean)
df <- na.omit(df)
colnames(df) <- c("geo","rich","rare","temp","prec")
```

### Biodiversity over geodiversity



```R
# Relationship between geodiversity and species richness
richgeo <- lm(rich ~ geo, data = df)
summary(richgeo)
plot(rich ~ geo, data=df)
abline(richgeo)

# Relationship between geodiversity and pecies rarity
raregeo <- lm(rare ~ geo, data = df)
summary(raregeo)
plot(rare ~ geo, data=df)
abline(raregeo)
```


```R
# First check the plot between temperature and precipitation
plot(prec ~ temp, data =df)

# Relationship between temperature / precipitation and species richness
richtemp <- lm(rich ~ temp, data = df)
summary(richtemp)
plot(rich ~ temp, data=df)
abline(richtemp)

richprec <- lm(rich ~ prec, data = df)
summary(richprec)
plot(rich ~ prec, data=df)
abline(richprec)
```

> 🔍 **Review 3**. Look at the plot showing the relationship between precipitation and temperature. Does the distribution of the points in this plot make sense? <br />

Yes, the distribution of the point cloud is consistent with the possible climate that we observe on earth. Look at the picture underneath explaining the different biomes by the combination of precipitation and temperature. The point cloud follows the same kind of 'wavey' outline. High values of precipitation do not really occur at subzero temperatures for instance.

> 📝 **Question **. Look at the plot between precipitation and species richness. Do you think a linear model is fitting for this data?
> <br />
> • Yes, there is a clear significant relationship between the two variables. <br />
> • No, the relationship between the variables appears to be more logarithmic.  <br />
> • Yes, the R-squared value shows that the majority of the variation is explained by this model. <br />
> • No, the slope coefficient (~0.02) is too small to confirm a linear relationship. <br />

<br />

Now also investigate the relationship between temperature and precipitation with species rarity. Write this code yourself by copying the code that analyzes the species richness with the climate data and adjusting it to species rarity.

```R
# With precipitation and temperature
richgeo_tempprec <- lm(rich ~ geo + temp + prec, data = df)
summary(richgeo_tempprec)

# With precipitation and temperature
raregeo_tempprec <- lm(rare ~ geo + temp + prec, data = df)
summary(raregeo_tempprec)
```
